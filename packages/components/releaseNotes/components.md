### version 2.327.0

### version 2.326.0
*Released*: 15 April 2023
- Entities subpackage migration
    - Moved `AssayResultsForSamplesButton`, `EntityCrossProjectSelectionConfirmModal`, `EntityDeleteConfirmModal`, `EntityInsertPanel` and `FindDerivativesButton` to subpackage.
    - Moved `getOriginalParentsFromLineage` to `@labkey/components` to align endpoint wrappers for use in `EntityAPIWrapper`.
- `EntityInsertPanel`:
    - Refactor initialization to separate concerns for initializing import aliases, name expression previews, `insertModel` and editable grid models.
    - Defer construction of column metadata until after load. Previously results were just thrown away.
    - Update all direct calls to endpoints to utilize `ComponentAPIWrapper` provided implementations.
    - `getInferredFieldWarnings` and `getNoUpdateFieldWarnings` are no longer static methods as this served no purpose
    - Refactored `getWarningFieldList` into `WarningFieldList` component
    - Remove superfluous render wrapping
- `ComponentAPIWrapper`:
    - Add `getEntityTypeData`, `getOriginalParentsFromLineage` and `handleEntityFileImport` to `EntityAPIWrapper`. Update associated usages where possible to use API wrapper.
    - Add `fetchDomainDetails` to `DomainPropertiesAPIWrapper`
    - Update `getDefaultAPIWrapper()` for `ComponentAPIWrapper` to instantiate wrappers once. Makes `api` easier for reuse in components to prevent redundant render cycles.
- Streamline some sample action implementations to use `async/await` and remove redundant error handling wrapping.
